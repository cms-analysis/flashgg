* STXS stage one workflow
Here are some examples to run the full stage one workspace production.

** Local testing
To run a test command locally to check everything works, you can use the local_test.sh script.
It is configured to run on a 2018 ggH signal sample, but you can switch the options and datasets
for other signals or data. 

** Full production
To produce the full set of inputs used to extract the final results, submit jobs to the batch. 

*** Signal
We keep three different jsons for the main signal samples, containing: 
- ggH, VBF, and WH
- ZH
- ttH and tH

WH and ZH have to be kept separate because they use the same input. 
The top samples can take longer to run, so they are also separated and run on a longer queue.

An example json file for the first of the three is shown in the example_sig.json file.
This can be run directly using the run_example_sig.sh file. 

*** Data
The data for the final fits is contained in just one json, an example of which is in the example_data.json file.
This can be run directly using the run_example_data.sh file.
