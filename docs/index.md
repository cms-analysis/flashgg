# Introduction

FLASHgg is the common software framework used as the basis for most analyses in the Higgs to two photons subgroup.
The main source of documentation is available directly on [the GitHub page](https://github.com/cms-analysis/flashgg) in the form of READMEs, 
including those in subdirectories of the repository.
Here, we provide a list of frequently asked questions that have been asked (and hopefully answered) in the past.

If you have a question that is not answered here, please send an email to the [flashgg list](mailto:cms-flashgg@cern.ch), 
where one of the FLASHgg experts will answer as soon as they can. 

For reference, the current members of the FLASHgg team are:
- codebase contacts: You-Ying Li and Yu Zhang
- microAOD contacts: Antoine Lesauvage and Lata Panwar
