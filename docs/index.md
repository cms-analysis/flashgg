# Introduction

FLASHgg is the common software framework used as the basis for most analyses in the Higgs to two photons subgroup.
The main source of documentation is available directly on [the GitHub page](https://github.com/cms-analysis/flashgg) in the form of READMEs,

Here, we provide a list of frequently asked questions that have been asked (and hopefully answered) in the past.

If you have a question that is not answered here, please send an email to the [flashgg list](mailto:cms-flashgg@cern.ch),
